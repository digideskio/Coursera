##### Week One: What is Cryptography
---
- **What Can Crypto Do?**
  - Crypto Core:
    - Secret key establishment
    - Secure communication
  - Additional features:
    - Digital signatures
    - Anonymous communication
    - Anonymous digital cash
  - Protocols
    - Secure multi-party computation
      - Elections
      - Private auctions
  - Crypto magic
    - Privately outsourcing computation
      - Ex: Google can perform search on encrypted data
    - Zero knowledge (proof of knowledge)
      - Alice knows ```N = pq```
      - Bob knows ```N```, not ```pq```
      - Alice can prove to bob she knows ```pq``` without learning ```pq```


- **A Rigorous Science**
  -Three steps in crypto:
    - Precisely specify threat model
    - Propose a construction
    - Prove that breaking construction under threat model will solve an underlying hard problem
